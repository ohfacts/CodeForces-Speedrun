I sit down, I start thinking about jokes. I get an idea. Wouldn't it be comedic if I did all ~7200 problems (and new ones as they come)  from codeforces and upload the entire thing over here?

I am laughing.

I am new to competetive coding and C++ in general. I want to get better at programming, at algorithms especially, like Richard Hendricks from JoJo. I dropped Unity and picked up SFML and C++ for this very reason. It's a 2D top-down RPG so it wont be as difficult, but it in the process I will learn alot ( as I have in the past few days) , and most importantly how to make stand alone programs. I am tired of just making scripts.



-I am doing this to get better , I have ordered the problems in increasing order of points and I solve them one after the other.

-Codeforces profile btw : https://codeforces.com/profile/ohfacts 

-Every now and then when I feel like Richard Hendricks from JoJo, I do tougher ones ( 1300 , 1000 , 900 done so far)

-I made a list of problems that I found to be good ( **I** found good), which I will go over from time to time

-I do about 10 in a day, so I epect this to be 2-3 years long, but I will get faster with time, (but questions will probably get longer with time, so who knows).

-(I don't cheat, haven't cheated ever either in any thing. I don't like having something like this written here or even talking about it, but I am , just for documentation purposes for those who wanted to know)

-why is my grammar so weird, my subject very agreement and tenses are so mixed up.

-If I don't get a question, I solve it till I get it. I discuss it with my friend Ice, we're both at the same level. I don't use Google for reference in this regard.

-When I am not solving questions, I try to go through "a competitive coder's hand book" (sumn like that) and C++ books 

-ohfacts/0f/zeroeff/occasionally 0facts . Remember these names(same person btw) , you'll see it pop up soon enough.
