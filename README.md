I sit down, I start thinking about jokes. I get an idea. Wouldn't it be comedic if I did all ~7200 problems (and new ones as they come)  from codeforces and upload the entire thing over here?

I am laughing.

I am new to competetive coding and C++ in general.

-I am doing this to get better , I have ordered the problems in increasing order of points and I solve them one after the other.

-Codeforces profile btw : https://codeforces.com/profile/ohfacts 

-Every now and then when I feel like Richard Hendricks from JoJo, I do tougher ones ( 1300 , 1000 , 900 done so far)

-I made a list of problems that I found to be good ( **I** found good), which I will go over from time to time

-I do about 10 in a day, so I epect this to be 2-3 years long, but I will get faster with time, (but questions will probably get longer with time, so who knows).

-(I don't cheat, haven't cheated ever either in any thing. I don't like having something like this written here or even talking about it, but I am , just for documentation purposes for those who wanted to know)

-why is my grammar so weird, my subject very agreement and tenses are so mixed up.

-If I don't get a question, I solve it till I get it. I don't use the internet for reference in this regard.

-When I am not solving questions, I try to go through "a competitive coder's hand book" (sumn like that) and C++ books 

-I refuse to make any grammatical corrections that I noticed upon re-reading ( stuff that straight up doesnt make sense because I had an idea and then I had ano- adventure time is my favourite tv show).

-Read get'nt to know which questions I didn't get so far( I shall get to it later) and other anomalies ( I shall speak to the CEO of codeforces)

-ohfacts/0f/zeroeff/occasionally 0facts . Remember these names(same person btw) , you'll see it pop up soon enough.
