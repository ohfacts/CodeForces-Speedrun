This is an indepth overview of what I got and didn't get and certain anamolies
If I end up getting something I will put "~~...~~". It doesnt seem to work for some reason. weird. Regardless, you know what to look out for.
Also, I will remove the .cpp file from this folder and paste the corrected solution in the appropriate folder. Old code will be commented on the bottom of the 
said .cpp file for preservation purposes.
Hence, this folder will only contain problems that I am "currently" unable to solve.
